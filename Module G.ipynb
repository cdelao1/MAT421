    "In python, we can integrate numerous functions, and really any function by whatever means necessary. From our introductory calculus courses, we learn integration as with trapezoids, then with what's called Simpson's rule. From there we delve into rectangular integration, otherwise known as Riemann integration. Of course this is different from the analysis definition we learn in upper division, but from a computational standpoint, our comfortable definition suffices. Here we can go ahead and make use of what's been given to us in the SciPy package."
